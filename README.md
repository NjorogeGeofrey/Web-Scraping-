# Web Scraping Remote Job Listings

This project is a web scraping tool that extracts remote job listings from the "We Work Remotely" website, focusing on full-stack programming jobs. The script uses Selenium for browser automation, allowing it to interact with dynamic content on the webpage.

## Features

- **Extract Job Titles**: The script extracts the title of each job listing.
- **Extract Job Links**: The direct URL to the job listing is retrieved.
- **Incognito Mode**: The browser is launched in incognito mode to prevent caching and cookies from affecting the scraping process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the script.
- **Selenium**: Used for browser automation and interaction with dynamic web content.
- **Pandas**: Utilized to store the scraped data in a structured format for further analysis or export.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Google Chrome**: The script uses the Chrome browser for web scraping.
- **ChromeDriver**: Download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version. Place it in a known directory.

### Required Python Packages

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas
```
